We are very pleased to announce the winners of these awards for SemEval-2024!

## Best Task Paper Award

The Best Task Paper award, for organizers of an individual shared task,
recognizes a task that stands out for making an important intellectual contribution to empirical computational semantics,
as demonstrated by a creative, interesting, and scientifically rigorous dataset and evaluation design,
and a well-written task overview paper.

## Best System Paper Award

The Best System Paper award, for task participants,
recognizes a system description paper that advances our understanding of a problem
and available solutions with respect to a task.
It need not be the highest-scoring system in the task,
but it must have a strong analysis component in the evaluation,
as well as a clear and reproducible description of the problem, algorithms, and methodology.
